I investigated generalizations of the *Curtis algorithm*, an inductive process for computing the homology of the lambda algebra, to determining motivic Adams $$E_2$$ pages. 

The lambda algebra is a differential graded algebra whose homology is the $$E_2$$ page of the Adams spectral sequence for the sphere. [Balderrama, Culver, and Quigley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07479) introduce a motivic version of the lambda algebra, and my project was to investigate a motivic analogue of the Curtis algorithm.

[My REU paper](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2022/REUPapers/Allen.pdf) gives an overview of the classical Curtis algorithm, and an appropriate motivic analogue. I managed to use the Curtis algorithm to automate the generation of classical Adams $$E_2$$ charts, in the style of [Isaksen, Wang and Xu](https://zenodo.org/record/6987157#.Y7h1HS-B1QI). A Github repository containing some of my code is available [here](https://github.com/ktallen/PyLambdaCalc); currently rough and uncommented, but if you want to use it feel free to let me know and I can get you started.
