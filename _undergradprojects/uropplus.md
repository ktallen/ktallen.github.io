I studied a 1957 algorithm of E.H. Brown, which can be used to determine the homotopy groups of any space obtained as the realization of a finite simplicial set.

I gave an explicit upper bound on the complexity of the algorithm when all homotopy groups are finite, and as a special case of when there are infinite homotopy groups, provided a bound on using the process to compute the homotopy groups of odd-dimensional spheres. 

You can find a preliminary draft [on the math department's website](https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/urop-plus/documents/2021/Allen.pdf).

### Errata
I don't think that my bound on the process involving the infinite group $$\pi_n(S^n) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$$ is quite correct; this likely does not have an effect on the asymptotic complexity, but I will revise when I get a chance.
