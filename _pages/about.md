My name is **Keita Allen**, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at MIT. Previously, I was an undergraduate at MIT.

I am broadly interested in **areas where algebra and geometry/topology intersect,** with a particular interest in and around algebraic topology/homotopy theory. 

Here is my [**CV**](https://ktallen.github.io/files/cv.pdf). For some more information, please see:

- the [**Research**](https://ktallen.github.io/projects/) tab for some of the math I have thought about,
- the [**Notes/Talks**](https://ktallen.github.io/notes/) tab for some more expository writing,
- the [**Teaching**](https://ktallen.github.io/teaching/) tab for some teaching material I have made,
- and the [**Contact, etc.**](https://ktallen.github.io/info/) tab for some information on myself, including how to reach me; my inbox is always open : )

My hope is that this site can provide you with some information on myself. Enjoy!
