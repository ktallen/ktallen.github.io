My name is **Keita Allen**, and I am a senior at MIT studying math. 

At the moment, I am broadly interested in **areas where algebra and geometry/topology intersect.**

Please see:
- the [**Math**](https://ktallen.github.io/projects/) and [**Teaching**](https://ktallen.github.io/teaching/) tabs to see some of the things I have been involved in at MIT,
- the [**CV**](https://ktallen.github.io/cv/) tab for a CV and list of coursework, and
- the [**Contact, etc.**](https://ktallen.github.io/aboutme/) tab for some information on myself, including how to reach me; my inbox is always open : )

My hope is that this site can provide you with some information on myself, and illustrate my journey through MIT. Enjoy!
