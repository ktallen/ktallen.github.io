Hi!

My name is **Keita Allen**, and I am a junior at MIT studying math. 

At the moment, I am particularly interested in **the areas where algebra and geometry/topology intersect.**

Please see:
- the **Academic** tab for a CV and list of coursework,
- the **Teaching** and **Research** tabs to see some of the things I have been involved in at MIT, and
- the **Contact** tab to see how to reach me; my inbox is always open : )

My hope is that this site can provide you with some information on myself, and illustrate my journey through MIT. Enjoy!
