My name is **Keita Allen**, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at MIT. Previously, I was an undergraduate at MIT.

I am studying **algebraic topology/homotopy theory**, and broadly interested in areas where algebra and geometry intersect. I am advised by [**Jeremy Hahn**](https://web.mit.edu/~jhahn01/www/). Here is my [CV](https://ktallen.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
