I am passionate about math education, particularly for the underserved. I am involved with the MIT Office of Minority Education through:

- [Interphase EDGE](https://ome.mit.edu/programs/interphase-edge-empowering-discovery-gateway-excellence), a program for rising MIT freshmen from underprivileged backgrounds, which I have both personally participated in and been a calculus facilitator for; and,
- the [Talented Scholars Resource Room](https://ome.mit.edu/programs/talented-scholars-resource-room-tsr2), a resource for MIT students to go for free tutoring in their subjects, where I am a tutoring facilitator mostly for math subjects.

I have also worked as a TA for the MIT Math Department. Please see the links below for some of the material I played a part in creating!
