I am passionate about math education, particularly for the underserved. I have been involved with the MIT Office of Academic Community, Empowerment, and Success through:

- [**Interphase EDGE**](https://oaces.mit.edu/programs/interphase-edge-empowering-discovery-gateway-excellence), a program for rising MIT first-year students from underprivileged backgrounds, which I have both personally participated in and been a calculus facilitator for; and,
- the [**Talented Scholars Resource Room**](https://oaces.mit.edu/programs/talented-scholars-resource-room-tsr2), a resource for MIT students to go for free tutoring in their subjects, where I was a tutoring facilitator mostly for math subjects.

If you have any questions about getting involved, I would be glad to talk!

Outreach
---
I am on the board for [**MIT GUMMI**](https://math.mit.edu/gummi/) (Grad-Undergrad Math Mentoring Initiative). Our goal is to help undergraduates at MIT navigate their way through the math major and towards graduate school. We are always glad to have more people involved! Please see the link for more information.

### Some more links
- [**Laureates and Leaders**](https://oaces.mit.edu/programs/laureates-leaders), a program for sophomores who are interested in applying to graduate school. They provide guidance and networking opportunities, in additional to certain financial subsidies for tests and applications.
