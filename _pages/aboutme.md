## About me.
I grew up in a small town in the south suburbs of Chicago, not doing very much math. Most of my summers were spent with family in Japan, and I seriously considered going to college in Japan for the food alone.

When I am procrastinating on my problem sets, I like to hang out with friends, watch YouTube, fiddle around on the piano, skim math papers that I don't really understand, and finally mess around with this website.
