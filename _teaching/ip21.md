I was a multivariable calculus TA, helping rising MIT first-year students from underprivileged backgrounds.

My good friend Abraham Montes (link coming soon!) and I were entrusted with assembling recitation sheets, in addition to some review material. You can find that material below; I can provide solutions upon request. Some of the problems are original; credit for the rest goes to the past Interphase staff.

You can find the material we made on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bfaUKP3VXnWX-1ciFe-5YZtjc3SPuWaa).
