The classical lambda algebra is a differential graded algebra, whose homology is the $$E_2$$ page of the Adams spectral sequence computing the stable homotopy groups of spheres. I investigated generalizations of the *Curtis algorithm*, an inductive process for computing this homology, to determining motivic Adams $$E_2$$ pages. 

I have been writing some code to help with various computations in the classical, $$\mathbb{C}$$-motivic, and $$\mathbb{R}$$-motivic lambda algebras. I've managed to use the Curtis algorithm to automate the generation of classical Adams charts, in the style of [Isaksen, Wang and Xu](https://zenodo.org/record/6987157#.Y7h1HS-B1QI); I'm currently working on automating the generation of $$\mathbb{C}$$-motivic charts.  

A Github repository containing some of my code is available [here](https://github.com/ktallen/PyLambdaCalc); currently rough and uncommented, but I plan on adding a manual soon. If you want to use it, feel free to let me know and I can get you started. 

A draft of a paper describing some of my work is available [here](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2022/REUPapers/Allen.pdf). Here, I give a description of the classical Curtis algorithm, and present a $$\mathbb{C}$$-motivic generalization. Still rough, but any comments are welcome!
