I gave a high-level overview of spectra and their relations to (co)homology theories. The talk was provided for *Chroma 2022*, an undergraduate-run summer seminar in stable/chromatic homotopy theory.

Here are some [notes](https://ktallen.github.io/files/chroma_notes.pdf) I took to prepare, and here are some [slides](https://ktallen.github.io/files/chroma_slides.pdf). That being said, I was very much an amateur when I was writing these (and still am), so I honestly do not recommend them as a reliable source. You can take a look at the sources I used if you want more trustworthy places to read up on things!
